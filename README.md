# FunModelling

This is a basic repo containing the scripts and some of the data I'm using for my master thesis. While very specific for my work, I heavily commented the scripts so that they can be adapted to other uses very easily

* `data` has the data. CSV files, clstr and so on. The file `whatData.md` in the folder explains what every file is. It doesn't have the rasters used as they exceeded the 100MB github limit
* 'script` has the scripts, mostly in R. The file `whatScript.md` in the folder explains every single file
