In this thesis I compiled and analysed an extensive database of mycorrhizal fungi that associate with European orchids. These results show that fungi are generally associated with individual orchid species, but that members of each OrM family often occur in a broad range of ecological conditions. Competitive and facilitative interactions may be common within OrM, and this study provides a platform for future experimental work. The use of hierarchical distribution models in this thesis showed that facilitative interactions between OrM OTUs may be common. These results provide an important first-step for understanding the environmental variables that may explain the distributions of these ecologically important fungi and help improve orchid conservation.
