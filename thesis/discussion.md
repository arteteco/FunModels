This thesis investigated the distribution and ecological factors of OrM across Europe using a combination of multivariate and joint species distribution modelling techniques. I found that, overall, both PCA and NMDS clustered together the OrM identified from different orchid species. This would support the idea of the OMFs generalist approach as being the most common, which is a still ongoing debate [#bailarote2012]

Also, variance was explained by two main variables, soil potassium and maximum precipitation of the wettest quarter, which means that those variables contribute the least to the definition of the niche and that the orchids were living in places highly differentiated in those parameters. This could also be the result of the very broad sampling, and more research should be done on a smaller scale, as the Potassium levels can dramatically vary even in a very small plot, doubling in just a few meters [#bogunovic2014].

From the NMDS Russulaceae seemed to be more tolerant than other families to different environments, and despite the lower number of sampled individuals we witness a higher variance. This could mean that the Russulaceae are more generalist toward orchids, that they have a wider niche, that it's more ecologically flexible, or all of the above. Russulaceae are a very diverse family, but it is actually difficult to say that Russulaceae find a "niche" in the symbiosis with orchids, especially with Limodorum, as there doesn't seem to be any advantage for the fungus: this orchids seem to have an insufficient photosynthesis and to heavily rely on the OMFs to provide not only minerals but also carbon-base chemicals; this also means that distribution of Limodorum may also be potentially constrained by the occurrence of its fungal symbionts [#girlanda2005].

The HMSC analysis showed clearly that there are residual correlations between OrM taxa. To my knowledge, this shows for the first time that OrM have ecological interactions beyond what is explained by environmental variables. Members of Ceratobasidiaceae tend to have positive residual correlations among taxa. This is interesting as the most broadly sampled orchid included in this study, Spiranthes spiralis, is predominately associated with OTUs of Ceratobasidiaceae. It could be that the positive residual co-occurrence are the result of facilitation between taxa of Ceratobasidiaceae, which may in turn positive affect orchid occurrence at a particular site.

The HMSC put the spotlight on Russulaceae again, with their negative correlation with the other families. This means that where we find Russulaceae, we are unlikely going to find other OMFs. This is probably the result of the main orchid species where Russulas were found in this dataset, *Limodorum abortivum*, which seems to show a specialization toward this family [#girlanda2005]. The rest of the data seem to confirm a major generalistic approach in the recruitment by orchids, also confirmed by the lack of any correlation between the different OTUs of the same family: the presence of one doesn't seem to inhibit other OTUs from the same family to infect the root.
