  abstract = {\textbullet{} To test the response of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi to a difference in soil pH, the extraradical mycelium of Scutellospora calospora or Glomus intraradices, in association with Plantago lanceolata, was exposed to two different pH treatments, while the root substrate pH was left unchanged. \textbullet{} Seedlings of P. lanceolata, colonized by one or other of the fungal symbionts, and nonmycorrhizal controls, were grown in mesh bags placed in pots containing pH-buffered sand (pH around 5 or 6). The systems were harvested at approximately 2-wk intervals between 20 and 80 d. \textbullet{} Both fungi formed more extraradical mycelium at the higher pH. Glomus intraradices formed almost no detectable extraradical mycelium at lower pH. The extraradical mycelium of S. calospora had higher acid phosphatase activity than that of G. intraradices. Total AM root colonization decreased for both fungi at the higher pH, and high pH also reduced arbuscule and vesicle formation in G. intraradices. \textbullet{} In conclusion, soil pH influences AM root colonization as well as the growth and phosphatase activities of extraradical mycelium, although the two fungi responded differently.},

Syngenetically preserved in a transitional, subaerially exposed paleoenvironment, these carbonaceous filaments of \textasciitilde 5 {$\mu$}m in width exhibit low-frequency septation (pseudosepta) and high-angle branching that can form dense interconnected mycelium-like structures.

Based on those combined evidences, these fossil filaments and mycelium-like structures are identified as remnants of fungal networks and represent the oldest, molecularly identified remains of Fungi.

  abstract = {Here, the coevolution of mycorrhizal fungi and roots is assessed in the light of evidence now available, from palaeobotanical and morphological studies and the analysis of DNA-based phylogenies. The first bryophyte-like land plants, in the early Devonian (400 million years ago), had endophytic associations resembling vesicular\textendash arbuscular mycorrhizas (VAM) even before roots evolved. Mycorrhizal evolution would have progressed from endophytic hyphae towards balanced associations where partners were interdependent due to the exchange of limiting energy and nutrient resources. Most mycorrhizas are mutualistic, but in some cases the trend for increasing plant control of fungi culminates in the exploitative mycorrhizas of achlorophyllous, mycoheterotrophic plants. Ectomycorrhizal, ericoid and orchid mycorrhizas, as well as nonmycorrhizal roots, evolved during the period of rapid angiosperm radiation in the Cretaceous. It is hypothesised that roots gradually evolved from rhizomes to provide more suitable habitats for mycorrhizal fungi and provide plants with complex branching and leaves with water and nutrients. Selection pressures have caused the morphological divergence of roots with different types of mycorrizas. Root cortex thickness and exodermis suberization are greatest in obllgately mycorrhizal plants, while nonmycorrhizal plants tend to have fine roots, with more roots hairs and relatively advanced chemical defences. Major coevolutionary trends and the relative success of plants with different root types are discussed.},

Although estimates have been made for arbuscular and ectomycorrhizal symbioses, these are based on incomplete budgets or indirect measurements. Furthermore, the conventional model of unidirectional plant-to-fungus C flux is too simplistic. Net fungus-to-plant C transfer supports seedling establishment in c. 10\% of plant species, including most orchids, and bidirectional C flows occur in ectomycorrhiza utilizing soil amino acids. \textbullet{} Here, the C cost of mycorrhizas to the green orchid Goodyera repens was determined by measurement of simultaneous bidirectional fluxes of 14C labelled sources using a monoxenic system with the fungus Ceratobasidium cornigerum. \textbullet{} Transfer of C from fungus to plant (`up-flow') occurs in the photosynthesizing orchid G. repens (max. 0.06 \textmu g) whereas over five times more current assimilate (min. 0.355 \textmu g) is simultaneously allocated in the reverse direction to the mycorrhizal fungus (`down-flow') after 8 d. Carbon is transferred rapidly, being detected in plant\textendash fungal respiration within 31 h of labelling. \textbullet{} This study provides the most complete C budget for an orchid\textendash mycorrhizal symbiosis, and clearly shows net plant-to-fungus C flux. The rapidity of bidirectional C flux is indicative of dynamic transfer at an interfacial apoplast as opposed to reliance on digestion of fungal pelotons.},

Here, we describe an ecosystem-level manipulation in 72 plots, which increased pH and/or P availability across six forests in Ohio, USA. Two years after treatment initiation, mycorrhizal fungi on roots were examined with molecular techniques, including 454-pyrosequencing. Elevating pH significantly increased arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal colonization and total fungal biomass, and affected community structure of AM and ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungi, suggesting that raising soil pH altered both mycorrhizal fungal communities and fungal growth. AM fungal taxa were generally negatively correlated with recalcitrant P pools and soil enzyme activity, whereas EcM fungal taxa displayed variable responses, suggesting that these groups respond differently to P availability. Additionally, the production of extracellular phosphatase enzymes in soil decreased under elevated pH, suggesting a shift in functional activity of soil microbes with pH alteration. Thus, our findings suggest that elevating pH increased soil P availability, which may partly underlie the mycorrhizal fungal responses we observed.},

Thus, the organisms traditionally studied by mycologists, and grouped in Whittaker's kingdom, are polyphyletic. Some, notably Mycetozoa and Plasmodiophorida, are related to certain Protozoa more closely than to true fungi; others are evolutionarily closer to certain algae. Conversely, organisms often thought to be very distinct from fungi (notably lichens) or previously outside the domain of mycology and botany (namely Microsporidia, formerly regarded as Protozoa) turn out to be true fungi, whereas oomycete moulds and ``white rusts'' are not!},

While this pattern has been observed for many different organisms, it is unclear whether the distributions of ecologically important belowground mutualists, such as orchid mycorrhizal fungi (OMF), also vary according to latitude. Location Europe. Taxon Spiranthes spiralis (L. Chevall) Orchidaceae. Methods We sampled 37 populations over a {$>$}3,000 km latitudinal gradient of the European orchid Spiranthes spiralis to test whether the diversity and community composition of OMF are influenced by latitude. For this, we sequenced the broad spectrum ITS3/4OF region to identify OMF and quantified environmental variables that may influence their occurrence. To assess whether seed germination was affected by suitable OMF in different regions, we performed a reciprocal translocation germination experiment at the northern, central and southern part of its range. Results In total, 75 OMF taxa were associated with S. spiralis, the majority belonging to the Ceratobasidiaceae and Thelephoraceae. Both taxonomic and phylogenetic OMF diversity decreased with increasing latitude. Three Ceratobasidiaceae taxa were widespread, but the number of sequences of two of these taxa decreased with increasing latitude. Reciprocal translocation germination experiments revealed that S. spiralis seeds germinated in each region regardless of seed provenance, but germination rates were highest in the southern part of its range where mycorrhizal diversity was highest. Main conclusions OMF diversity decreased with increasing latitude, indicating that communities of OMF may be shaped by latitudinal gradients. These results highlight the need to understand the factors that determine the distribution of belowground mutualists, which are essential to predict how plant distributions will shift under future environmental change.},

Among the `lower' plants only mosses and Equisetum appear to lack one or other of these types of association. The salient features of the symbioses produced by each fungal group are described and the relationships between these associations and those formed by the same or related fungi in `higher' plants are discussed. Particular consideration is given to the question of the extent to which root\textendash fungus associations in `lower' plants are analogous to `mycorrhizas' of `higher' plants and the need for analysis of the functional attributes of these symbioses is stressed.Zygomycetous fungi colonize a wide range of extant lower land plants (hornworts, many hepatics, lycopods, Ophioglossales, Psilotales and Gleicheniaceae), where they often produce structures analogous to those seen in the vesicular\textendash arbuscular (VA) mycorrhizas of higher plants, which are formed by members of the order Glomales. A preponderance of associations of this kind is in accordance with palaeobotanical and molecular evidence indicating that glomalean fungi produced the archetypal symbioses with the first plants to emerge on to land.It is shown, probably for the first time, that glomalean fungi forming typical VA mycorrhiza with a higher plant (Plantago lanceolata) can colonize a thalloid liverwort (Pellia epiphylla), producing arbuscules and vesicles in the hepatic. The extent to which these associations, which are structurally analogous to mycorrhizas, have similar functions remains to be evaluated.Ascomycetous associations are found in a relatively small number of families of leafy liverworts. The structural features of the fungal colonization of rhizoids and underground axes of these plants are similar to those seen in mycorrhizal associations of ericaceous plants like Vaccinium. Cross inoculation experiments have confirmed that a typical mycorrhizal endophyte of ericaceous plants, Hymenoscyphus ericae, will form associations in liverworts which are structurally identical to those seen in nature. Again, the functional significance of these associations remains to be examined.Some members of the Jungermanniales and Metzgeriales form associations with basidiomycetous fungi. These produce intracellular coils of hyphae, which are similar to the pelotons seen in orchid mycorrhizas, which also involve basidiomycetes. The fungal associates of the autotrophic Aneura and of its heterotrophic relative Cryptothallus mirabilis have been isolated. In the latter case it has been shown that the fungal symbiont is an ectomycorrhizal associate of Betula, suggesting that the apparently obligate nature of the association between the hepatic and Betula in nature is based upon requirement for this particular heterotroph.},

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonize plant root systems and modulate plant growth in various ways.This review addresses the significance of arbuscular mycorrhiza in alleviation of salt stress and their beneficial effects on plant growth and productivity. It also focuses on recent progress in unravelling biochemical, physiological and molecular mechanisms in mycorrhizal plants to alleviate salt stress.The role of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in alleviating salt stress is well documented. This paper reviews the mechanisms arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi employ to enhance the salt tolerance of host plants such as enhanced nutrient acquisition (P, N, Mg and Ca), maintenance of the K+ : Na+ ratio, biochemical changes (accumulation of proline, betaines, polyamines, carbohydrates and antioxidants), physiological changes (photosynthetic efficiency, relative permeability, water status, abscissic acid accumulation, nodulation and nitrogen fixation), molecular changes (the expression of genes: PIP, Na+/H+ antiporters, Lsnced, Lslea and LsP5CS) and ultra-structural changes. Theis review identifies certain lesser explored areas such as molecular and ultra-structural changes where further research is needed for better understanding of symbiosis with reference to salt stress for optimum usage of this technology in the field on a large scale. This review paper gives useful benchmark information for the development and prioritization of future research programmes.},

Tests of hypotheses to account for such diversity have been stymied by the lack of a fully resolved broad-scale phylogeny. Here, we provide such a phylogeny, based on 75 chloroplast genes for 39 species representing all orchid subfamilies and 16 of 17 tribes, time-calibrated against 17 angiosperm fossils. A supermatrix analysis places an additional 144 species based on three plastid genes. Orchids appear to have arisen roughly 112 million years ago (Mya); the subfamilies Orchidoideae and Epidendroideae diverged from each other at the end of the Cretaceous; and the eight tribes and three previously unplaced subtribes of the upper epidendroids diverged rapidly from each other between 37.9 and 30.8 Mya. Orchids appear to have undergone one significant acceleration of net species diversification in the orchidoids, and two accelerations and one deceleration in the upper epidendroids. Consistent with theory, such accelerations were correlated with the evolution of pollinia, the epiphytic habit, CAM photosynthesis, tropical distribution (especially in extensive cordilleras), and pollination via Lepidoptera or euglossine bees. Deceit pollination appears to have elevated the number of orchid species by one-half but not via acceleration of the rate of net diversification. The highest rate of net species diversification within the orchids (0.382 sp sp-1 My-1) is 6.8 times that at the Asparagales crown.},

Until now, the lack of a well-resolved phylogeny has prevented analyses of orchid historical biogeography. In this study, we use such a phylogeny to estimate the geographical spread of orchids, evaluate the importance of different regions in their diversification and assess the role of long-distance dispersal (LDD) in generating orchid diversity. Location Global. Methods Analyses use a phylogeny including species representing all five orchid subfamilies and almost all tribes and subtribes, calibrated against 17 angiosperm fossils. We estimated historical biogeography and assessed the importance of different regions for rates of speciation, extinction and net species diversification. We evaluated the impact of particular LDD events on orchid diversity by asking how many species evolved in the new range subsequent to those events. Results Orchids appear to have arisen in Australia 112 Ma (95\% higher probability distribution: 102.0\textendash 120.0 Ma), then spread to the Neotropics via Antarctica by 90 Ma (HPD: 79.7\textendash 99.5 Ma), when all three continents were in close contact and apostasioids split from the ancestor of all other orchids. Ancestors of vanilloids, cypripedioids and orchidoids+epidendroids appear to have originated in the Neotropics 84\textendash 64 Ma. Repeated long- and short-distance dispersal occurred through orchid history: stochastic mapping identified a mean total of 74 LDD events or 0.8 Ma-1. Across orchid history, Southeast Asia was the most important source and maximally accelerated net diversification; across epidendroids, the Neotropics maximally accelerated diversification. Main conclusions Our analysis provides the first biogeographical history of the orchids, implicating Australia, the Neotropics and Antarctica in their origin.

These below-ground fungi play a key role in terrestrial ecosystems as they regulate nutrient and carbon cycles, and influence soil structure and ecosystem multifunctionality. Up to 80\% of plant N and P is provided by mycorrhizal fungi and many plant species depend on these symbionts for growth and survival. Estimates suggest that there are c. 50 000 fungal species that form mycorrhizal associations with c. 250 000 plant species. The development of high-throughput molecular tools has helped us to better understand the biology, evolution, and biodiversity of mycorrhizal associations. Nuclear genome assemblies and gene annotations of 33 mycorrhizal fungal species are now available providing fascinating opportunities to deepen our understanding of the mycorrhizal lifestyle, the metabolic capabilities of these plant symbionts, the molecular dialogue between symbionts, and evolutionary adaptations across a range of mycorrhizal associations. Large-scale molecular surveys have provided novel insights into the diversity, spatial and temporal dynamics of mycorrhizal fungal communities. At the ecological level, network theory makes it possible to analyze interactions between plant\textendash fungal partners as complex underground multi-species networks. Our analysis suggests that nestedness, modularity and specificity of mycorrhizal networks vary and depend on mycorrhizal type. Mechanistic models explaining partner choice, resource exchange, and coevolution in mycorrhizal associations have been developed and are being tested. This review ends with major frontiers for further research.},

Here we describe two fragments of exceptionally preserved, probably charred, lichen thalli with internal stratification. Cyanolichenomycites devonicus has a cyanobacterial and Chlorolichenomycites salopensis a unicellular, presumably green algal photobiont. Fruiting bodies are missing. Cyanolichenomycites devonicus forms asexual spores in a pycnidium. All specimens were examined with scanning electron microscopy techniques. The fossils were extracted by maceration. Extant lichens and free-living cyanobacteria were either experimentally charcoalified for comparison or conventionally prepared. Based on their septate hyphal structure, both specimens are tentatively interpreted as representatives of the Pezizomycotina (Ascomycota). Their presence in 415 million yr (Myr) old rocks from the Welsh Borderland predates existing Late Cretaceous records of pycnidial conidiomata by some 325 Myr and Triassic records of lichens with broadly similar organization by some 195 Myr. These fossils represent the oldest known record of lichens with symbionts and anatomy as typically found in morphologically advanced taxa today. The latter does not apply to Winfrenatia reticulata, the enigmatic crustose lichen fossil from the Lower Devonian, nor to presumed lichen-like organisms such as the Cambrian Farghera robusta or to the Lower Devonian Spongiophyton minutissimum.},

Especially, non-rewarding species are characterized by infrequent pollinator visits and low seed set. Therefore, it can be hypothesized that, if overall population fitness of orchid species is influenced by seed production, non-rewarding species should be more prone to local extinction than rewarding species. To study the importance of nectar reward on orchid persistence, we collected historical records about the distribution of 32 orchid species in Flanders (Belgium) and 37 orchid species in the Netherlands. For both regions, present distribution patterns were compared with historical data. Between 1930 (Flanders) or 1950 (the Netherlands) and 2000, 26 (81\%) species showed decreases in distribution range in Flanders, eight of which had gone extinct, whereas 29 (78\%) species showed declines in distribution area in the Netherlands, five of which went extinct. Contrary to previously reported results, orchid distribution patterns were not related to nectar reward. There was also no significant relationship between nectar reward and extinction for both regions. Orchids typically occurring in wet grasslands and heathlands suffered greater losses than orchids typically confined to forest habitats or calcareous grasslands. We conclude that the production of nectar does not represent a safeguard for local extinction of orchid species. Habitat loss and other deterministic threats associated with habitat fragmentation and deterioration are more important determinants of orchid persistence.},

  abstract = {Most orchid mycorrhizal fungi (OMF) are free-living decomposers that do not depend on orchids for establishment or survival. Despite their importance for completion of the orchid life cycle, the geographical distribution of OMF remains poorly understood. Here we review studies that examined the relationship between orchids and their mycorrhizal associates and place them in a biogeographical context. We first describe the diversity of OMF and then examine the patterns of OMF distributions according to geographical locations, biomes, and islands. OMF have been found across all major biogeographic realms and biomes. While the distribution of the major mycorrhizal fungal families that associate with orchids appears to be entirely cosmopolitan, we know little about how the distribution of particular OMF shapes the distribution of the orchids that rely on them. In the face of ongoing rapid anthropogenic influence on the natural environment, more information is needed to show how OMF communities vary across large geographical scales and how this affects the distribution of orchids. In particular, we need to identify the environmental variables (e.g., rainfall, geological substrate) that drive spatial variation in OMF communities. This information will be crucial for setting up future orchid conservation and restoration projects.},

Current classifications assume that chytrids form an early-diverging clade within the kingdom Fungi and imply a single loss of the spore flagellum, leading to the diversification of terrestrial fungi. Here we develop phylogenetic hypotheses for Fungi using data from six gene regions and nearly 200 species. Our results indicate that there may have been at least four independent losses of the flagellum in the kingdom Fungi. These losses of swimming spores coincided with the evolution of new mechanisms of spore dispersal, such as aerial dispersal in mycelial groups and polar tube eversion in the microsporidia (unicellular forms that lack mitochondria). The enigmatic microsporidia seem to be derived from an endoparasitic chytrid ancestor similar to Rozella allomycis, on the earliest diverging branch of the fungal phylogenetic tree.},

Nearly every species declined between the surveys in both countries, and two species may have become extinct in the UK. Mean decline in distribution range for 49 species in the UK was 50\% (range 14\textendash 100\%), and 23 species declined by over 50\%. The mean decline for 33 orchid species in Estonia was 25\% (range 0\textendash 62\%), and three species declined by over 50\%. These results corroborate serious range declines recently reported for orchids in other regions of Europe (the Netherlands and Flanders, Belgium). In contrast with these other regions, we found that species associated with calcareous grassland and woodland habitats had suffered greater mean contractions in range than species of wet grassland habitats. Greater decline was recorded for species found on drier soils, and for species characteristic of open habitats. In addition, greater decline was found in species with short inflorescences, and in species that were short-lived, and clonal. Our results suggest that levels of decline shown both by groups of species associated with specific habitat types, and by particular species of orchid, depend strongly on local policies and specific conservation action, and indicate the habitat types on which conservation efforts may need to be concentrated in the future. The results suggest that grazing and mowing of competing vegetation, and avoidance of substrate disturbance, will produce the greatest rewards for the most vulnerable species.},

We analyzed contemporary trends in the threat levels of European orchids, in total 166 species characterized in 27 national red lists, in relation to their reproductive biology and growth form, distribution area, and land cover where they occur. We found that species in central Europe are more threatened than those in the northern, southern, or Atlantic parts of Europe, while species were least threatened in southern Europe. Nectarless and tuberous species are significantly more threatened than nectariferous and rhizomatous taxa. Land cover (ratios of artificial land cover, area of pastures and grasslands, forests and inland wetlands) also significantly impacted the threat level. A bigger share of artificial land cover increases threat, and a bigger share of pasture and grassland lowers it. Unexpectedly, a bigger share of inland wetland area in a country increased threat level, which we believe may be due to the threatened nature of wetlands themselves relative to other natural land cover types. Finally, species occurring in multiple countries are on average less threatened. We believe that large-scale analysis of current IUCN national red lists as based on their specific categories and criteria may particularly inform the development of coordinated regional or larger-scale management strategies. In this case, we advocate for a coordinated EU protection and restoration strategy particularly aimed at central European orchids and those occurring in wetland area.},

  abstract = {More than 400 species of vascular plants, in 87 genera, are acholophyllous and heterotrophic, but not directly parasitic upon autotrophs. They are usually, but incorrectly, described as 'saprophytes'since they are in fact nourished by means of specialized mycorrhizal associations. Although distributed world-wide, they are most abundant and show the greatest species-richness in the Neotropics and Palaeotropical regions. Their aerial parts range in size from a few centimetres to extensive liane types up to 40 m long. With few exceptions, their habitats are dense moist forests in which there is a surface accumulation of leaf litter, often in situations which are too shaded for autotrophic growth. Although the achlorophyllous mycorrhizal mode of life has evolved independently many times and in widely disparate taxonomic groups, such plants show strong convergent evolution in particular adaptations to their peculiar mode of life. Most prominant amongst these are reductions in the size of seed and embryo, and the lack of differentiation of the embryo at maturity. The number of seeds produced by each flower is typically very large and the shape, structure and surface features of seeds involving adaptation for wind dispersal show remarkable parallels in many species. Specific adaptations for zoochory are rare but well developed in a small number of genera, some of which produce scents like fungal fruit bodies or floral parts which mimic fungal sporocarps. Vegetative parts are often even more conspicuously reduced. Most myco-heterotrophs are entirely subterranean for most of their lives and these stages exhibit adaptations consistent with a change in function from organs of absorption to organs of storage, shown by the almost universal loss of root hairs, decrease in surface area as exhibited in short cylindric`vermiform'and tuberous roots or, in extreme cases, the complete suppression of roots and the formation of a swollen tuber or rhizome. Increased width of the root cortex often accommodates mycorrhizal infection and stores of carbohydrates and other materials obtained from the fungal symbiont. Mycorrhizal infection is confined to the below-ground parts of the plants but may be found there in modified stems as well as in roots. In many genera, stems are exceptionally slender and thread-like and their vascular tissues are either reduced to a single narrow cylinder of bicollateral bundles or, minimally, to four or six narrow bundles in the cortex. Secondary thickening is poorly developed in all but a tiny minority of species, lignification being confined to annular or, rarely, a few scalariform xylem vessels. Phloem is present in very small amounts and then mainly as parenchyma with sieve tubes frequently recorded as narrow and possibly with abherent sieve plates. Leaves are typically reduced to widely spaced achlorophyllous scales on the inflorescence axis. Occasionally, they are present only on underground rhizomes or tubers. The vascular supply to the leaf-scales, normally reduced to a single trace, may be absent. Vestigial stomata are sometimes found on leaves and, in a few species which retain traces of chlorophyll, on shoots but, in most fully heterotrophic species, stomata are absent from aerial parts. Since their seeds are very small and contain minimal reserve carbohydrates, the germination of myco-heterotrophs in nature would appear to depend upon infection by an appropriate symbiotic fungus at an early stage. The nature of the carbohydrates transferred from the fungus to the plants has not been determined. Once acquired from The fungal partner, most plants store carbon in a variety of forms, the most common of which is starch, although other compounds including glucomannan, fructan and calcium oxalate art important in some specks. Asexual reproduction is frequently important with root tubers, tubercles and rhizomes providing the means of vegetative spread. Nonetheless, all the angiospermous species recorded to date also reproduce sexually. Floral structures show varying degrees of reduction concomitant with myco-heterotrophy. Inflorescences are typically small, often with a single terminal flower, and the floral parts often show extreme simplification, with the production of unilocular or, more rarely, bilocular and trilocular ovaries. In some of the most highly adapted species, there is reduction of integumentary layers surrounding each ovule from the normal bitegmic condition to unitegmic or, occasionally, ategmic. With the principal exception of the Monotropaceae, placentation is typically trimerous and parietal. Flowers normally appear to be cross-pollinated and are brightly coloured. nectiferous, occasionally scented, and can demonstrate extreme morphological adaptations which attract insects as in the production of lone caudate tepals or fungus-mimicking structures. Much is still to be learned about the adaptive features and especially about the physiology of these plants and of their early developmental stages during which the essential associations with fungi are established. Similarly, studies of the taxonomy and physiology of most of their fungal partners are still in their infancy.},

  abstract = {Nitrogen availability may be a major factor structuring ectomycorrhizal fungal communities. Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition has been implicated in the decline of ectomycorrhizal fungal (EMF) sporocarp diversity. We previously characterized the pattern of decreased sporocarp species richness over an anthropogenic N deposition gradient in Alaska (USA). To determine whether this change in sporocarp community structure was paralleled below ground, we used molecular and morphological techniques to characterize the ectomycorrhizal community of white spruce (Picea glauca) over this gradient. We then related patterns of richness and relative abundance of taxa to various N-affected environmental parameters. Species richness of EMF declined dramatically with increasing N inputs. Over 30 taxa were identified at the low-N sites, compared with nine at the high-N sites. Low-N site dominants (Piloderma spp., Amphinema byssoides, Cortinarius spp., and various dark-mantled Tomentella spp.) disappeared completely at the high-N sites, where they were replaced by Lactarius theiogalus, Paxillus involutus, Tylospora fibrillosa, Tomentella sublilacina, Thelephora terrestris, and an unidentified species. Lactarius theiogalus accounted for 44\textendash 68\% of the root tips at the high-N sites, compared with 7\textendash 20\% of tips at the low-N sites. Organic horizon mineral N and foliar nutrient ratios (N:P, P:Al) were excellent predictors of taxonomic richness (r2 {$>$} 0.93). Organic horizon NO3- availability was the best predictor of abundance of many taxa. These patterns suggest that long-term N deposition can lead to decline in EMF species richness, and dramatic changes in EMF community structure. The consequences of these changes for plant nutrition and ecosystem function depend on how EMF community function changes as community structure changes. We speculate that as N inputs increase, the EMF community shifts from taxa specialized for N uptake under low-N conditions (e.g., Cortinarius, Piloderma), toward taxa specialized for high overall nutrient availability (e.g., Tomentella sublilacina, Thelephora terrestris) and finally toward taxa specialized for P uptake under high-N, low-P, acidified conditions (e.g., Paxillus involutus, Lactarius theiogalus).},

Assuming that these inconsistencies stem from various causes, we reassessed the systematic placement of the most important fungal fossil, Paleopyrenomycites, and recalibrated internally unconstrained, published molecular clock trees by applying uniform calibration points. As a result the origin of fungi was re-estimated at between 760 million and 1.06 billion y ago and the origin of the Ascomycota at 500\textendash 650 million y ago. These dates are much more consistent than previous estimates, even if based on the same phylogenies and molecular clock trees, and they are also much better in line with the fossil record of fungi and plants and the ecological interdependence between filamentous fungi and land plants.

  abstract = {Mycorrhizae, the symbioses between fungi and plant roots, are nearly universal in terrestrial plants and can be classified into two major types: endomycorrhizae and ectomycorrhizae. About four-fifths of all land plants form endomycorrhizae, whereas several groups of trees and shrubs, notably Pinaceae, some Cupressaceae, Fagaceae, Betulaceae, Salicaceae, Dipterocarpaceae, and most Myrtaceae form ectomycorrhizae. Among legumes, Papilionoideae and Mimosoideae have endomycorrhizae and usually form bacterial nodules. The members of the third subfamily, Caesalpinioideae, rarely form nodules, and one of the included groups, the two large, pantropical, closely related tribes Amherstieae and Detarieae, regularly form ectomycorrhizae. Nodules and ectomycorrhizae may well be alternative means of supplying organic nitrogen to the plants that form them. Those plants having endomycorrhizae usually occur in forests of high species richness, whereas those with ectomycorrhizae usually occur in forests of low species richness. The roots of ectomycorrhizal trees, however, support a large species richness of fungal symbionts, probably amounting to more than 5000 species worldwide, whereas those of endomycorrhizal trees have low fungal species richness, with only about 30 species of fungi known to be involved worldwide. Ectomycorrhizal forests are generally temperate or occur on infertile soils in the tropics. They apparently have expanded in a series of ecologically important events through the course of time from the Middle Cretaceous onward at the expense of endomycorrhizal forests.},

The pollinarium is the male reproductive structure, transferred as a single unit during pollination, complete with a mass of pollen grains.

By combining this information with dates from related fossil plants, a new calibration of the molecular phylogeny of the Orchidaceae has been obtained.

There is an increasing evidence of specific relationships between orchids and fungi, though usually not on a species-to-species level. Physiological compatibility demonstrated under artificial conditions, as in vitro, may be much broader, however. Recent development of field sowing techniques has improved the possibilities of evaluating orchid-fungal relations in an ecological context. Although the general nutrient flow in orchid mycorrhiza is well known, some questions remain regarding breakdown processes of fungi within orchid tissues, especially the ptyophagic syndrome that has recently been illustrated at the ultrastructural level for the first time.},

  abstract = {Mycorrhizae, due to their key position at the plant-soil interface, are important to consider in the study of ecosystem impacts of global changes. Human-induced changes in the earth's environment are clearly multi-factorial. Examples of important factors are: elevated concentrations of atmospheric gases (for example carbon dioxide or ozone), increased input of nutrients into ecosystems by atmospheric deposition (for example nitrogen), climate change (including altered precipitation and temperature regimes), invasive species, and increased UV-radiation. All of these components of future or present global changes can have positive or negative impacts on mycorrhizal associations. However, a more fundamental distinction has to be made between these factors, paying tribute to the fact that in the mycorrhizal symbiosis we are dealing with two classes of organisms with partially independent biology. There are those factors that directly affect only the host plant (e.g., carbon fixation), and that only have indirect effects on mycorrhizal fungi (mycobionts) via altered carbon allocation from the host. Examples include atmospheric changes, against which soil serves largely as a buffer. Other factors can (in addition) directly affect the mycobionts, for example warming or altered precipitation. This distinction is crucial for a mechanistic understanding of the impact of global change factors, and for experimental approaches. Global change factors rarely occur in isolation. The complexity of regional combinations of global change factors further highlights the need for mechanistic studies, since direct experimental exploration of a large number of scenarios would be virtually impossible. Finally, processes and patterns at larger temporal and spatial scales have to be considered in an assessment of global change impacts on mycorrhiza. Most experiments only allow access to short-term responses, while longer-term responses are really relevant. Possible approaches include the use of natural experiments, for example, CO2 springs. Large-scale processes such as shifts in the global distribution of plant communities (or their regional extinction) due to climate change would affect mycorrhiza, for example, alter the current distribution of mycorrhizal types on the globe. With potential impacts on host biodiversity, mycobiont species diversity may also be impacted at regional scales. In addition, changes in the mycorrhizal fungal community that are independent of changes in the plant community may be one of the least-understood, but potentially most important, mycorrhizal responses to global change.},

The identity and pattern of colonization of fungal associates providing carbon to this orchid have not been studied previously.Using samples from 34 individuals from 18 populations in Japan, Russia and France, the following were investigated: (a) colonization patterns of fungal associates of E. aphyllum by microscopy; (b) their identity by PCR amplification of nuclear ribosomal ITS carried out on rhizome fragments and hyphal pelotons.Microscopic investigations revealed that thick rhizomes were densely colonized by fungi bearing clamp-connections and dolipores, i.e. basidiomycetes. Molecular analysis identified Inocybe species as exclusive symbionts of 75 \% of the plants investigated and, more rarely, other basidiomycetes (Hebeloma, Xerocomus, Lactarius, Thelephora species). Additionally, ascomycetes, probably endophytes or parasites, were sometimes present. Although E. aphyllum associates with diverse species from Inocybe subgenera Mallocybe and Inocybe sensu stricto, no evidence for cryptic speciation in E. aphyllum was found. Since basidiomycetes colonizing the orchid are ectomycorrhizal, surrounding trees are probably the ultimate carbon source. Accordingly, in one population, ectomycorrhizae sampled around an individual orchid revealed the same fungus on 11{$\cdot$}2 \% of tree roots investigated. Conversely, long, thin stolons bearing bulbils indicated active asexual multiplication, but these propagules were not colonized by fungi. These findings are discussed in the framework of ecology and evolution of mycoheterotrophy.},

This analysis is the most taxonomically complete to date with species sampled from all 15 currently circumscribed classes. A number of superclass-level nodes that have previously evaded resolution and were unnamed in classifications of the Fungi are resolved for the first time. Based on the 6-gene phylogeny we conducted a phylogenetic informativeness analysis of all 6 genes and a series of ancestral character state reconstructions that focused on morphology of sporocarps, ascus dehiscence, and evolution of nutritional modes and ecologies. A gene-by-gene assessment of phylogenetic informativeness yielded higher levels of informativeness for protein genes (RPB1, RPB2, and TEF1) as compared with the ribosomal genes, which have been the standard bearer in fungal systematics. Our reconstruction of sporocarp characters is consistent with 2 origins for multicellular sexual reproductive structures in Ascomycota, once in the common ancestor of Pezizomycotina and once in the common ancestor of Neolectomycetes. This first report of dual origins of ascomycete sporocarps highlights the complicated nature of assessing homology of morphological traits across Fungi. Furthermore, ancestral reconstruction supports an open sporocarp with an exposed hymenium (apothecium) as the primitive morphology for Pezizomycotina with multiple derivations of the partially (perithecia) or completely enclosed (cleistothecia) sporocarps. Ascus dehiscence is most informative at the class level within Pezizomycotina with most superclass nodes reconstructed equivocally. Character-state reconstructions support a terrestrial, saprobic ecology as ancestral. In contrast to previous studies, these analyses support multiple origins of lichenization events with the loss of lichenization as less frequent and limited to terminal, closely related species.},

Moreover, chlorophyllous Neottieae species show naturally occurring achlorophyllous individuals. We investigated the fungal associates of such a member of the Neottieae, Epipactis microphylla, to understand whether their mycorrhizal fungi predispose the Neottieae to mycoheterotrophy. Root symbionts were identified by sequencing the fungal ITS of 18 individuals from three orchid populations, including achlorophyllous and young, subterranean individuals. No rhizoctonias (the usual orchid symbionts) were recovered, but 78\% of investigated root pieces were colonized by Tuber spp. Other Pezizales and some Basidiomycetes were also found. Using electron microscopy, we demonstrated for the first time that ascomycetes, especially truffles, form typical orchid mycorrhizae. All identified fungi (but one) belonged to taxa forming ectomycorrhizae on tree roots, and four of them were even shown to colonize surrounding trees. This is reminiscent of mycoheterotrophic orchid species that also associate with ectomycorrhizal fungi, although with higher specificity. Subterranean and achlorophyllous E. microphylla individuals thus likely rely on tree photosynthates, and a partial mycoheterotrophy in individuals plants can be predicted. We hypothesize that replacement of rhizoctonias by ectomycorrhizal symbionts in Neottieae entails a predisposition to achlorophylly.},

The physiological and cellular processes allowing carbon gain from the fungus are not well understood. We believe that this phenomenon is overlooked and propose several land plant families and ecosystems that should be investigated for possible mixotrophy. We speculate that mixotrophy allowed, in some lineages, the evolution of heterotrophic plants, that is, non-photosynthetic plants that obtain their carbon from organic compounds. Moreover, the amount of carbon gained from the fungus varies from one site to another in mixotrophs. Drawing a parallel with mixotrophy in planktonic algae, we propose some hypotheses that could account for this.},

Yet, their algal ancestors were poorly pre-adapted to such a life at the interface. We review the paleontological evidence that fungal symbioses which can exploit substrate resources, helped adaptation to land constraints. Diverse structures dating back to the Devonian present convincing evidence for lichens, (symbioses between fungi and microscopic algae) but fossils remain scarce, so that early lichen abundance and ecological relevance remain questionable. Several enigmatic but abundant fossils from the Siluro-Devonian, such as \emph{Spongiophyton{$<$}i/{$>$}or the giant \emph{Prototaxites{$<$}i/{$>$} (Nematophytes), likely represent fungus-algal symbioses, which shaped early terrestrial ecosystems. Yet, these taxa are fully extinct, and do not have clear affinities with extant groups. Finally, terrestrialization of Embryophyta (land plants), which currently dominate land ecosystems, is linked to a symbiosis with Glomeromycetes. Today, these fungi form arbuscular mycorrhizae, which help most Embryophyta to exploit soil, and molecular data combined with paleontological evidence support the idea that this type of association is ancestral. The role of symbiotic Mucoromycetes during terrestrialization is not fully understood and mycorrhizal association diversified later in the evolution of Embryophyta. Fungal-algal symbioses thus recurrently contributed to terrestrialization of phototrophs.}}},

  abstract = {Animals are evolutionarily related to fungi and to the predominantly unicellular protozoan phylum Choanozoa, together known as opisthokonts. To establish the sequence of events when animals evolved from unicellular ancestors, and understand those key evolutionary transitions, we need to establish which choanozoans are most closely related to animals and also the evolutionary position of each choanozoan group within the opisthokont phylogenetic tree. Here we focus on Ministeria vibrans, a minute bacteria-eating cell with slender radiating tentacles. Single-gene trees suggested that it is either the closest unicellular relative of animals or else sister to choanoflagellates, traditionally considered likely animal ancestors. Sequencing thousands of Ministeria protein genes now reveals about 14 with domains of key significance for animal cell biology, including several previously unknown from deeply diverging Choanozoa, e.g. domains involved in hedgehog, Notch and tyrosine kinase signaling or cell adhesion (cadherin). Phylogenetic trees using 78 proteins show that Ministeria is not sister to animals or choanoflagellates (themselves sisters to animals), but to Capsaspora, another protozoan with thread-like (filose) tentacles. The Ministeria/Capsaspora clade (new class Filasterea) is sister to animals and choanoflagellates, these three groups forming a novel clade (filozoa) whose ancestor presumably evolved filose tentacles well before they aggregated as a periciliary collar in the choanoflagellate/sponge common ancestor. Our trees show ichthyosporean choanozoans as sisters to filozoa; a fusion between ubiquitin and ribosomal small subunit S30 protein genes unifies all holozoa (filozoa plus Ichthyosporea), being absent in earlier branching eukaryotes. Thus, several successive evolutionary innovations occurred among their unicellular closest relatives prior to the origin of the multicellular body-plan of animals.},

Limits of paleontological vs genetic approaches and perspectives 1023 Acknowledgements 1025 References 1025 Summary The ability of fungi to form mycorrhizas with plants is one of the most remarkable and enduring adaptations to life on land. The occurrence of mycorrhizas is now well established in c. 85\% of extant plants, yet the geological record of these associations is sparse. Fossils preserved under exceptional conditions provide tantalizing glimpses into the evolutionary history of mycorrhizas, showing the extent of their occurrence and aspects of their evolution in extinct plants. The fossil record has important roles to play in establishing a chronology of when key fungal associations evolved and in understanding their importance in ecosystems through time. Together with calibrated phylogenetic trees, these approaches extend our understanding of when and how groups evolved in the context of major environmental change on a global scale. Phylogenomics furthers this understanding into the evolution of different types of mycorrhizal associations, and genomic studies of both plants and fungi are shedding light on how the complex set of symbiotic traits evolved. Here we present a review of the main phases of the evolution of mycorrhizal interactions from palaeontological, phylogenetic and genomic perspectives, with the aim of highlighting the potential of fossil material and a geological perspective in a cross-disciplinary approach.},

In this paper we report the first unequivocal evidence of a lichen symbiosis from the Rhynie chert. Specimens of a new genus, Winfrenatia, consist of a thallus of superimposed layers of aseptate hyphae and, on the upper surface, numerous uniform depressions. Extending into the base of each depression are hyphae that form a three-dimensional netlike structure. Enclosed within each of the net spaces is a coccoid cyanobacterium, each cell of which is surrounded by a thick sheath. These photobiont cells divide in three planes, resulting in cell clusters of up to perhaps 64 individuals. The photobiont is parasitized by the fungus in the base of each net as new cyanobacterial cells are formed distally. Reproduction is by endospores and soredia. Affinities of the mycobiont appear closest to members of the Zygomycetes, while the photobiont is most similar to coccoid cyanobacteria of the Gloeocapsa and Chroococcidiopsis types. We speculate that this cyanobacterial symbiosis was well adapted to exploit and colonize new ecological niches, especially in the periodically desiccated environment postulated for the Rhynie chert paleoecosystem.},

Photosynthetic plants typically associate with a broad range of mycorrhizal fungi, while non-photosynthetic plants that capture energy from mycorrhizal fungi (`myco-heterotrophs') are often specialized towards particular taxa. Sister myco-heterotroph species are often specialized towards different fungal taxa, suggesting rapid evolutionary shifts in specificity. Within-species variation in specificity has not been explored. Here, we tested whether genetic variation for mycorrhizal specificity occurs within the myco-heterotrophic orchid Corallorhiza maculata. Variation across three single-nucleotide polymorphisms revealed six multilocus genotypes across 122 orchids from 30 sites. These orchids were associated with 22 different fungal species distributed across the Russulaceae (ectomycorrhizal basidiomycetes) according to internal-transcribed-spacer sequence analysis. The fungi associated with four out of the six orchid genotypes fell predominantly within distinct subclades of the Russulaceae. This result was supported by Monte Carlo simulation and analyses of molecular variance of fungal sequence diversity. Different orchid genotypes were often found growing in close proximity, but maintained their distinct fungal associations. Similar patterns are characteristic of insect populations diversifying onto multiple hosts. We suggest that diversification and specialization of mycorrhizal associations have contributed to the rapid radiation of the Orchidaceae.},

  abstract = {Microorganisms are critical in the bio- and geosphere today, and certainly performed similar functions in ancient ecosystems. Bacteria, cyanobacteria, microalgae, and various fungi and fungi-like organisms constitute a substantial component of these ancient communities, and have been responsible for the evolution and sustainability of the ecosystems in functions ranging from decomposition of metabolites to catalyzation of nutrient cycles. This review provides examples of associations and interactions between microorganisms and land plants, principally from the Devonian and Carboniferous. During this time span of approximately 150 myr, most of the vascular plant lineages evolved and radiated into new terrestrial niches. Several exceptionally well-preserved fossil communities are used to demonstrate a wide range of biological interactions. Although none of the land plant partners exist today, many of the microorganisms involved appear morphologically little changed. Moreover, some interactions suggest that the genetic code and biochemical pathways necessary for the associations and interactions to be successful evolved early in the lineages of microorganisms involved, and have seemingly remained unchanged to the present. The examination of microorganism/land plant associations (and interactions) provides another level of biological resolution that can be used to track coevolutionary processes and help formulate hypotheses designed to more fully understand the evolutionary history of ecosystems.},

In orchids, it is connected with a mycorrhizal shift from rhizoctonia to ectomycorrhizal fungi and a high natural 13C and 15N abundance. Some green relatives of mycoheterotrophic species show identical trends, but most of these remain unstudied, blurring our understanding of evolution to mycoheterotrophy. We analysed mycorrhizal associations and 13C and 15N biomass content in two green species, Neottia ovata and N. cordata (tribe Neottieae), from a genus comprising green and nongreen (mycoheterotrophic) species. Our study covered 41 European sites, including different meadow and forest habitats and orchid developmental stages. Fungal ITS barcoding and electron microscopy showed that both Neottia species associated mainly with nonectomycorrhizal Sebacinales Clade B, a group of rhizoctonia symbionts of green orchids, regardless of the habitat or growth stage. Few additional rhizoctonias from Ceratobasidiaceae and Tulasnellaceae, and ectomycorrhizal fungi were detected. Isotope abundances did not detect carbon gain from the ectomycorrhizal fungi, suggesting a usual nutrition of rhizoctonia-associated green orchids. Considering associations of related partially or fully mycoheterotrophic species such as Neottia camtschatea or N. nidus-avis with ectomycorrhizal Sebacinales Clade A, we propose that the genus Neottia displays a mycorrhizal preference for Sebacinales and that the association with nonectomycorrhizal Sebacinales Clade B is likely ancestral. Such a change in preference for mycorrhizal associates differing in ecology within the same fungal taxon is rare among orchids. Moreover, the existence of rhizoctonia-associated Neottia spp. challenges the shift to ectomycorrhizal fungi as an ancestral pre-adaptation to mycoheterotrophy in the whole Neottieae.},

Phylogenetic analysis revealed six main clades within Ceratobasidiaceae and a poor correlation between molecular phylogeny and morphological\textendash cytological characters traditionally used for taxonomy. Sequences derived from soil (representing putative saprotrophs) and orchid mycorrhiza clustered together, but remained distinct from pathogens. All nutritional modes were phylogenetically conserved in the Ceratobasidiaceae based on at least one index. Our analyses suggest that in general, autotrophic orchids form root symbiosis with available Ceratobasidiaceae isolates in soil.

The time estimate for the chordate-arthropod divergence, using 50 genes, is 993 +/- 46 Ma. Nematodes were found to have diverged from the lineage leading to arthropods and chordates at 1177 +/- 79 Ma. Phylogenetic analyses also show that a basal position of nematodes has strong support (p {$>$} 99\%) and is not the result of rate biases. The three-way split (relationships unresolved) of plants, animals and fungi was estimated at 1576 +/- 88 Ma. By inference, the basal animal phyla (Porifera, Cnidaria, Ctenophora) diverged between about 1200-1500 Ma. This suggests that at least six animal phyla originated deep in the Precambrian, more than 400 million years earlier than their first appearance in the fossil record.},

Several findings from this survey enhance our understanding of the roles of mycorrhizas in the origin and subsequent diversification of land plants. First, 80 and 92\% of surveyed land plant species and families are mycorrhizal. Second, arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) is the predominant and ancestral type of mycorrhiza in land plants. Its occurrence in a vast majority of land plants and early-diverging lineages of liverworts suggests that the origin of AM probably coincided with the origin of land plants. Third, ectomycorrhiza (ECM) and its derived types independently evolved from AM many times through parallel evolution. Coevolution between plant and fungal partners in ECM and its derived types has probably contributed to diversification of both plant hosts and fungal symbionts. Fourth, mycoheterotrophy and loss of the mycorrhizal condition also evolved many times independently in land plants through parallel evolution.},

  abstract = {Both pollination by animals and mycorrhizal symbioses with fungi are believed to have been important for the diversification of flowering plants. However, the mechanisms by which these above- and belowground mutualisms affect plant speciation and coexistence remain obscure. We provide evidence that shifts in pollination traits are important for both speciation and coexistence in a diverse group of orchids, whereas shifts in fungal partner are important for coexistence but not for speciation. Phylogenetic analyses show that recently diverged orchid species tend either to use different pollinator species or to place pollen on different body parts of the same species, consistent with the role of pollination-mode shifts in speciation. Field experiments provide support for the hypothesis that colonization of new geographical areas requires adaptation to new pollinator species, whereas co-occurring orchid species share pollinator species by placing pollen on different body parts. In contrast to pollinators, fungal partners are conserved between closely related orchid species, and orchids recruit the same fungal species even when transplanted to different areas. However, co-occurring orchid species tend to use different fungal partners, consistent with their expected role in reducing competition for nutrients. Our results demonstrate that the two dominant mutualisms in terrestrial ecosystems can play major but contrasting roles in plant community assembly and speciation.},

  abstract = {Within the basidiomycetes, the vast majority of known mycorrhizal species are homobasidiomycetes. It was therefore surprising when molecular and ultrastructural studies revealed a broad diversity of mycorrhizal associations involving members of the heterobasidiomycetous Sebacinaceae, fungi which, due to their inconspicuous basidiomes, have been often overlooked. To investigate the phylogenetic position of the Sebacinaceae within the basidiomycetes and to infer phylogenetic relationships within the Sebacinaceae, we made molecular phylogenetic analyses based on nuclear rDNA. We present a well-resolved phylogeny of the main lineages of basidiomycetes which suggests that the Sebacinaceae is the most basal group with known mycorrhizal members. Since more basal taxa of basidiomycetes consist of predominantly mycoparasitic and phytoparasitic fungi, it seems possible that a mycorrhizal life strategy, which was transformed into a saprotrophic strategy several times convergently, is an apomorphic character for the Hymenomycetidae. Mycorrhizal taxa of Sebacinaceae, including mycobionts of ectomycorrhizas, orchid mycorrhizas, ericoid mycorrhizas, and jungermannioid mycorrhizas, are distributed over two subgroups. One group contains species with macroscopically visible basidiomes, whereas members of the other group probably lack basidiomes. Sebacina appears to be polyphyletic; current species concepts in Sebacinaceae are questionable. Sebacina vermifera sensu Warcup \& Talbot consists of a broad complex of species possibly including mycobionts of jungermannioid and ericoid mycorrhizas. This wide spectrum of mycorrhizal types in one fungal family is unique. Extrapolating from the known rDNA sequences in Sebacinaceae, it is evident that there is a cosm of mycorrhizal biodiversity yet to be discovered in this group. Taxonomically. we recognise the Sebacinaceae as constituting a new order, the Sebacinales.},

Sebacinales (Agaricomycetes, Basidiomycota) display highly diverse interactions with plants. Although early-diverging Sebacinales lineages are root endophytes and/or have saprotrophic abilities, several more derived clades harbour obligate biotrophs forming mycorrhizal associations. Sebacinales thus display transitions from saprotrophy to endophytism and to mycorrhizal nutrition within one fungal order. This review discusses the genomic traits possibly associated with these transitions. We also show how molecular ecology revealed the hyperdiversity of Sebacinales and their evolutionary diversification into two sister families: Sebacinaceae encompasses mainly ectomycorrhizal and early-diverging saprotrophic species; the second family includes endophytes and lineages that repeatedly evolved ericoid, orchid and ectomycorrhizal abilities. We propose the name Serendipitaceae for this family and, within it, we transfer to the genus Serendipita the endophytic cultivable species Piriformospora indica and P. williamsii. Such cultivable Serendipitaceae species provide excellent models for root endophytism, especially because of available genomes, genetic tractability, and broad host plant range including important crop plants and the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We review insights gained with endophytic Serendipitaceae species into the molecular mechanisms of endophytism and of beneficial effects on host plants, including enhanced resistance to abiotic and pathogen stress.},
