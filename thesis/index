1. State-of-the-art - what do we know about OMF these fungal families - their distribution, their ecology, their phylogenetic relationships and taxonomy.
2. The hypotheses you want to test.
3. The importance of assessing phylogenetic relationships.
4. What variables you selected and why.
5. What analysis you performed - phylogenetic analyses (including information on gene regions, alignment etc.), NMDS and PCA and why.
6. Results - what are the broad patterns in the data? What are the phylogenetic relationships between the fungi? Do different mycorrhizas associate with different habitats? What are their geographical distributions? You can check my paper on Spiranthes and Tesitelova et al. (2015) for examples of this.
