## Phylogenetic analysis

The **Bayesian analysis** yielded low probability branches. Nonetheless, it correctly put together the families, with the only notable exception of the _Serendipitaceae_ and _Sebacinaceae_ which were nested separately. This makes sense though, as they are both _Sebacinales_ and the _serendipitaceae_ were originally considered _sebacinaceae B_ [#weiss2004] and were only recently given a new name and properly defined [#weiss2016]
* The **Maximum parsimony analysis** gave similar results, with very low bootstrap support
