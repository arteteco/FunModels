# Introduction



## What do we know about OMFs taxonomy

While the relationship between orchids and Orchid Micorrhizal fungi (OMF from now) are known since over a century (Bernard N, 1899; Selosse et al. 2011; M. C. Rayner, 1927; Rasmussen, 2002) and the mechanisms of this symbiosis are beginning to be properly understood, the knowledge as to who those OMFs are from a taxonomical standpoint are still in full evolution.

For many years orchids were thought to interact almost entirely with the members of the _Rhizoctonia_ complex. It was later discovered that not only that orchid have way more interactions with more kind of fungi also from the __Ascomycetes, but also that _rhizoctonia_ is a polyphyletic group, and was disassembled in many taxas, all members of the _Agaricomycetes_, most notably **_Sebacinales, Ceratobasidiaceae_** and **_Tulasnellaceae_** (J.D.W. Dearnaley et al., 2012).

There is also evidence of fungi from the _Ascomycota_ phylum, especially in the order _Pezizales_ (Selosse et al. 2004, Waterman et al. 2011), but they are the exception more than the rule.

The most common and known families of OMFs at the moment of writing are in the _Basidiomycota_ phylum, especially _Inocybaceae_, _Tulasnellaceae_, _Ceratobasidiaceae_, _Russulaceae_, _Sebacinaceae_, _Serendipitaceae_ and _Thelephoraceae_ (e.g. Roy et al. 2009, Jacquemyn et al. 2010, Duffy et al, 2018, Taylor et al. 2004).

Those families are not comprised of OMFs only, but 

The knowledge is still lacking in many key aspects though, and more research is needed in order to zoom to a more detailed identification of the OMF


## Distribution of OMFs

Orchids depend on fungi for the germination of the seeds and in many cases for the nutrients also in adulthood, so it is safe to assume that OMFs are everywhere orchids are, that is, in all continents except Antartica (Givnish et al. 2016). This is not the whole tale though, as we know that many OMFs can also turn to a soil free-living saprotrophic ecological niche and form mycorrhizal relationship with plants other than orchids (e.g. Selosse et al. 2014), allowing them to spread in a bigger area.

*Tulasnellaceae, Ceratobasidiaceae,* and *Sebacinales*(*Serendipitaceae *and *Sebacinaceae*) are ubiquitous, varying in their contribution to the total amount of OMFs depending on the area and in the level of specialization for the orchids.
Other families, even though less common, still have a presence in most of the world (Jaquemyn et al. 2015).

Both OMFs and orchids vary in their degree of specialization, from a highly specialized to a more generalist approach (van der Heijden et al. 2015).

Many parts of the world are dramatically undersampled though (e.g. all the African continent and most of the tropical areas of the planet), so conclusions are often drew from a limited amount of very specific data.
