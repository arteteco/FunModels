The kingdom Fungi is one of the most diverse groups of organisms on Earth. Fungi play an important role in the ecosystem and have a huge impact on biogeochemical cycles, plant and animal pathology, plant nutrition and soil properties.
While historically fungi were taxonomically clustered with plants [#copeland1938, copeland1956], towards the middle of the twentieth century it became clear that failed to properly deal with the differences between the two groups. In 1969 R. H. Whittaker divided the organisms into five kingdoms: Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Protista and Monera [#whittaker1969]. By the 1970s this division became widely accepted, and the Kingdom Fungi was recognized.
However, due to limitations understanding of the taxonomy, evolution and phylogenesis of fungi was still a matter of ample debate. All the analysis were based on morphological differences, with all of its downsides.

The fossil record for fungi is meager and even though the known fossils cover almost all major fungal lineages [#lucking2009], it is rather incomplete relative to the evolutionary history of the various fungal lineages. The earliest compendium of fossil fungi is from the late 19th century [#meschinelli1898], and their symbiotic relationship with plants in fossils was suggested around that period [#renault1896], but the difficulty in the interpretation of morphological data made it impossible to actually understand what happened.

Earliest fossil with the morphological features of a fungus is dated to around 1 billion years ago, and was found in the Arctic Canada [#loron2019], and there is evidence of fungus-like organisms in fossils of around 800 Mya [#bonneville2020].
Starting from the lower Devonian (around 400 Mya), fossil record is more abundant [#lucking2009]

It was not until the development of molecular phylogenetics techniques that some light could be properly shed on the evolutionary history of fungi [#james2006].
The molecular clock is one of the most widely used tools to investigate the timing of phylogenetic events. It is based on the hypothesis of the constancy of the rate of evolution with time and, when combined with the use of fossil records, allows the dating of branching events on phylogenetic trees [#lepage2007, weir2008].
From molecular clock analysis seems like fungi are sister group to animals, that is, the two lineages are close, diverging around 1.5 billion years ago [#wang1999]. The two groups form one supergroup called Opisthokhonta [#cavalier-smith1987], from the Greek opísthios (rear, posterior) and kontós ("pole" i.e. "flagellum"), since the group is characterized by flagellate cells that propel themselves with a single, posterior flagellum, now lost in most fungi [#steenkamp2006] with the notable exception of the Chytridiomycota division [#james2006a].

IMG OF TREE WITH ANIMALS AND FUNGI AND PLANTS


The ancestors of fungi are believed to be simple aquatic forms with flagellated spores, similar to members of the extant phylum Chytridiomycota (chytrids), which are now considered one of the early-diverging clade in the kingdom [#james2006]. The first terrestrial fungi colonized land probably before plants [#heckman2001], as saprobe (taking nutrition out of dead matter) and/or in symbiosis with organisms capable of photosynthesis. 
It is commonly accepted that in order to colonize the land, plants had to develop a symbiotic relationship with fungi [#selosse1998, heckman2001, bonneville2020], but it is not entirely clear whether this relationship was lichen-like (an algae or cyanobacteria living among filaments of a single or more fungi) [#spribille2016] or mycorrhizal-like, where the fungus colonizes the host plant's root tissues. 


IMG LICHEN 

Lichens are the symbiotic relationship between a single or more fungi (*mycobiont*) and a cyanobacteria or algae (*photobiont*). Early plants that transitioned from aqueous environments were poorly equipped to deal with the challenges of a terrestrial life style: mainly, decompose the mineral substrate to absorb nutrients, to protect itself against dehydration, UV radiations and temperature fluctuations [#selosse1998, blackwell2000]. By forming relationships with fungi (i.e. a lichen), the photobiont is protected by the fungal stroma, and it can tolerate drought, cold, heat, intense light and barren rocky substrates. Indeed they also seem to be pioneers of harsh environment today.

Yet, while the relationship between plants and fungi evolved several times [#gargas1995], the only fungal group we know that are capable of forming such association (called _lichenization_) are Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. The origin of those clades can be dated to about 400 Mya in the Devonian period [#berbee1993]. Similarly there are fossils for lichens dating at the oldest in the Early Devonian (400 Mya) [#taylor1997, honegger2013], while the first fossil land plants and fungi appeared 480 to 460 Mya, and molecular clock estimates suggests about 600-700 Mya [#berbee1993, heckman2001]. 

Therefore, lichens were likely not what opened the way to plants for land colonization. 

The mycorrhizal association is a symbiotic association between plants and fungi happening in the rhizosphere, the plant's root system [#barman2016]. In this interaction there is an exchange of resources between the mycorrhizal fungus and the plant, ideally the plant providing sugar to the fungus and the fungus providing minerals and nutrients to the plant. However, this is not always the case and upon closer analysis, there appears to be a continuum of plant responses to mycorrhizal colonization ranging from positive to neutral to negative, and the same goes for the fungi [#johnson1997]

Fossils resembling mycorrhizal relationships date to the Ordovician (with an age of about 460 million years), and are Glomales-like Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (AMF hereafter), in a moment where the land flora was comprised mainly of bryophytes, pteridophytes and algae [#redecker2000]. Plants can photosynthetize; these fungi can extract minerals from the substrate with great efficiency, protect the root system, extend the range from which water can be taken and protect the plants from pathogens.

Fossil records provides evidence that fungal organisms entered in such symbiosis before the appearance of true roots, and as long as there is a multicellular host AM fungi are fine [#wang2006, bonfante2008].

Whether as lichen or as mycorrhiza, the symbiosis between plants and fungi is one of the most important, most ancient relationship in the history of living beings and it surely played a crucial role in the successful colonization of the land by plants [#pirozynski1975, malloch1980, harley1987, trappe1987, selosse1998, brundrett2002]. The relationship is so beneficial (for one or both parts) that today is the norm, and is well established in c. 85% of extant plants [#cairney2000, strullu-derrien2018], with a high degree of complexity [#heijden2015] and mycorrhizal networks often constitute 20%–30% of total soil microbial biomass [#leake2011]

## Orchid-mycorrhizal fungi relationship

Orchidaceae is a diverse and widespread family of flowering plants, containing over 28,000 species in about 736 genera [#christenhusz2016], second only to _Asteraceae_ in terms of species numbers [#ramirez2007]. They are cosmopolitan, with a distribution spanning all continents except Antarctica and including most major island groups [#givnish2016].
By the end of 2017 the IUCN Global Red List included assessments for 948 orchid species, of which 56.5% are threatened [#fay2018]. In Europe all wild orchids are protected, being included in their entirety on Appendices I and II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora [#CITES-1] as are many of the habitats they live in, and are listed on the Red List of many countries. Nonetheless, this protection has not staved off a general decline in the orchid flora of Europe [#jacquemyn2005, kull2006]. Major threats include habitat destruction and unsustainable (often illegal) harvesting, and because of their complex life histories orchids are thought to be particularly vulnerable to the effects of global environmental change [#kull2016, gale2018]

Orchids exhibit a high diversity of habitat adaptations, morphologies and pollination strategies, but some characteristics are common to the whole family. One of the most important is the reliance on Orchid Mycorrhizal Fungi (OrM hereafter) for reproduction and survival. This is because orchids seeds are devoid of nutritional resources, and they completely rely on fungi for nutrition including water, minerals and carbon supply [#leake1994, rasmussen1998, merckx2013] in a nutritional strategy called "mycoheterotrophy". After germination, seedlings often become autotrophic and subsequently revert to usual mycorrhizal functioning [#rasmussen1995, cameron2008]. Some species, especially from forest environments, remain mycoheterotrophic at adulthood though, developing partial photosynthetic capacity but still relying on fungi for carbon resources, a nutritional strategy called "mixotrophy" or "partial mycoheterotrophy" [#gebauer2003, julou2005, selosse2009]. Others never develop photosynthetic capacity and therefore rely completely on fungi for nutrition. This nutritional mode, which has evolved over 30 times independently in orchids, is called "obligate mycoheterootrophy" [#merckx2013].

While the relationship between orchids and OrM is known for over a century [#bernard1899, rayner1927, rasmussen2002, selosse2011] and the mechanisms of this symbiosis are beginning to be properly understood, the knowledge from a taxonomical standpoint is still unclear. For many years orchids were thought to interact almost entirely with a specific clade of fungi, members of the _Rhizoctonia_ complex. It was later discovered not only that orchids have way more interactions with different fungi also from the _Ascomycetes_ phylum, but also that _rhizoctonia_ is a polyphyletic group, and was disassembled in different taxa, all members of the _Agaricomycetes_, most notably **_Sebacinales, Ceratobasidiaceae_** and **_Tulasnellaceae_** [#dearnaley2012].
There is also evidence of fungi from the _Ascomycota_ phylum, especially in the order _Pezizales_ [#selosse2004, ouanphanivanh2008, waterman2011], but they are thy are exception: the most common and known families of OrM are in the _Basidiomycota_ phylum, particularly _Inocybaceae_, _Tulasnellaceae_, _Ceratobasidiaceae_, _Russulaceae_, _Sebacinaceae_, _Serendipitaceae_ and _Thelephoraceae_ [#taylor2004, roy2009, duffy2019]

### Distribution and ecology of orchid mycorrhizal fungi

Orchids depend on OrM for the germination of their seeds and in many cases for nutrient provision also in adulthood, we assume that OrM must co-occur with the orchid population. However, many OrM can also turn to a soil free-living saprotrophic ecological niche [#oberwinkler2017] and form mycorrhizal relationships with plants other than orchids [#selosse2014]. Members of the *Tulasnellaceae, Ceratobasidiaceae,* and *Sebacinales*(*Serendipitaceae* and *Sebacinaceae*) are ubiquitous, with varying relative abundances [#jacquemyn2017]. 

Environmental factors that underlie the distribution of OrM taxa are poorly understood. Abiotic variables such as annual rainfall, temperature regimes and soil chemical properties should explain the distribution of many taxa. However, local biotic interaction, community composition and interactions may influence the OrM distribution, especially considering they are symbiotic organisms [#jacquemyn2017]. Overall, there is a lack of evidence, and many parts of the world are undersampled (e.g. all the African continent and most of the tropical areas of the planet). Therefore, it is difficult conclude that the occurrence of OrM taxa are structured by biotic variables based on a limited amount of data. A part of the problem is that the relationships between orchids and OrM are complex. They both vary in their degree of specialization, from a highly specialized to a more generalist [#mccormick2004, girlanda2011, heijden2015], and OrM may be able to revert to saprophytic free-living lifestyles[#veldre2013].

In this thesis, I investigate the distribution and ecological factors underlying the occurrence OrM throughout Europe. I analyzed the OrM taxa associated with 16 different orchid species that occur in different regions throughout Europe. Specifically, I focus on two over-arching questions;
1. do similar OrM taxa occur in similar habitats and have similar environmental preferences?
2. Are similarities in OrM co-occurrence explained better by positive environmental correlations or are there residual taxa correlations that may suggest ecological processes beyond environmental filtering (e.g. competition and facilitation)?
